# TO_DO_LIST
A To-Do List application is a simple program that allows users to manage and organize their tasks effectively. It typically provides functionalities such as adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. Users can input tasks they need to complete, view the list of tasks with their status, indicate when tasks are done, and remove tasks as needed. This type of application is useful for personal organization and task management, helping users stay productive and keep track of their responsibilities.
