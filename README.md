I applied for python programming internship at CODSOFT. They give me some task to perform.
Following are the task I perform;
# TO_DO_LIST
A To-Do List application is a simple program that allows users to manage and organize their tasks effectively. It typically provides functionalities such as adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. Users can input tasks they need to complete, view the list of tasks with their status, indicate when tasks are done, and remove tasks as needed. This type of application is useful for personal organization and task management, helping users stay productive and keep track of their responsibilities.
# CALCULATOR
This Python program creates a simple calculator that allows users to input two numbers and choose from basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It continuously prompts the user for input and displays the result until the user decides to quit the program. The calculator includes error handling to prevent division by zero and handles invalid input gracefully.
